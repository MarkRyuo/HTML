            <p>Anime's roots can be traced back to the early 20th century, with the first Japanese animated films emerging in the
            1910s. However, it was not until the 1960s, with the rise of iconic creators like Osamu Tezuka, that anime began to take
            its modern form. Tezuka's influential work, including "Astro Boy," set the stage for the evolution of anime into a
            distinct and recognizable style.</p>
